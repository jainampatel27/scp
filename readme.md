A simple, free, and open-source SFTP client for macOS, built with Electron. This application allows you to securely connect to SFTP servers and browse, upload, and download files through an intuitive graphical interface.

## Why This App?

Many existing SFTP clients are either paid or require complex setup that beginners find difficult. We created this app to provide a free, open-source alternative that's easy to use and set up, especially for macOS users. We also provide compiled versions alongside the open-source code for added convenience.
